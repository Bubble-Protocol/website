            <p>
              Bubble Protocol stores content in off-chain bubbles. A bubble is a secure vault containing files and directories whose access permissions are managed by a smart contract.  The bubble itself is hosted by a provider chosen by the user. Whenever content is requested from the bubble, the provider checks the access permissions from the smart contract, only permitting the request if the requester has the appropriate permissions. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The smart contract for a bubble is designed specifically for each use case and can be as simple or as complex as needed to control the content throughout its life.  Once the smart contract indicates the bubble has been terminated, the off-chain bubble is ‘popped’ and all its content is deleted.

          <span class="section-title">Permissions</span>
          <div class="section-paragraphs">
            <p>
              Each bubble is uniquely identified by its smart contract address, blockchain id and host provider.  Each piece of content hosted by the protocol is uniquely identified by its bubble id and 32-byte file id (often the file id is defined as the content hash).  The smart contract specifies separate <code>read/write/append/execute</code> permissions for each user address and 32-byte file id.  This way each file can have different access permissions for every user.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any smart contract can be used to control a bubble provided it implements the following interface:

          <span class="section-title">Bubble Providers</span>
          <div class="section-paragraphs">
            <p>Bubbles are stored on a provider of the user’s choosing. Providers can be public, restricted or private.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Public providers</b> are designed to be generic hosts, capable of hosting any bubble for any application. Forthcoming Bubble payment contracts will allow providers to earn rewards for providing storage to general users.  See the <a href="docs/tokenomics.pdf" target="_blank">Tokenomics White Paper</a>.</li>
              <li><b>Restricted providers</b> are public providers that restrict the type of bubble that can be deployed, only allowing bubbles managed by certain types of smart contract.</li>
              <li><b>Private providers</b> restrict access to authorised users only. Examples are: </li>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Home providers</b> used only by family and friends.</li>
                <li><b>Company providers</b> used by registered customers, employees and suppliers.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Anyone can become a bubble provider by deploying a server running Bubble Protocol’s Guardian software or by integrating the Guardian into existing infrastructure.
              The Guardian acts as a gateway to the underlying bubble storage layer, authorising requests based on the permissions defined in the bubble’s smart contract.
              The Guardian does not specify the underlying storage mechanism, allowing the protocol to be used with file systems, databases, decentralised storage networks, content delivery networks and other infrastructure.

          <span class="section-title">Encryption</span>
          <p>
            Content within a bubble can be public or encrypted.
            Content encryption is managed by a client encryption policy, which specifies the encryption method, if any, for each piece of content within the bubble.
            Encryption policies are fully customizable, allowing the developer to choose one or more encryption methods and to specify which content is encrypted.
            Bubble Protocol ships with AES-GCM encryption out of the box.

        <div class="page-width-section">
          <span class="section-title">User Management</span>
          <p>
            A bubble's smart contract defines which users are permitted to access which content within the bubble.
            For encrypted bubbles, Bubble Protocol provides support for multiple users, allowing each user to decrypt the bubble contents with their private key.
            This removes the inconvenience and security concerns of pre-sharing encryption keys with all users of a bubble.

          <span class="section-title">The Bubble Network</span>
          <p>
            The Bubble Network is a decentralised peer-to-peer network currently under construction.
            It will be a fully decentralised off-chain storage network, like IPFS, but with access controls and token-based storage payments.
            It will form an ideal off-chain storage layer for Web3 applications, supporting both public and private data storage, permissioned data access, content deletion and data sharing capabilities, all in a fully decentralised manner.
            The network will not replace other bubble providers but will run alongside them, giving users, developers and businesses a full suite of options for Web3 storage.
